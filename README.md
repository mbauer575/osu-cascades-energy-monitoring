# osu-cascades-energy-monitoring

OSU Cascades Energy Monitoring Project 
is a project to monitor the energy usage of the OSU Cascades campus. 
We get the data in CSV's from the facilities servers, and then we use Python to parse the data and put it into a database.
We then use streamlit to display the data in a web app.

Get started by installing the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then running `streamlit run LandingPage.py` to start the web app.
